  <div class="subtitle">Mongolia Before The Discovery</div>

  <div class="content">
    Long before its rise to fame, the Flaming Cliffs—known locally as Bayanzag—were merely a remote area within Mongolia’s Gobi Desert. Named <b>“Bayanzag”</b> by locals for its abundance of <b>saxaul trees</b> ("bayan" meaning rich and "zag" meaning saxaul), the region was known primarily to local herders, who often stumbled upon unusual bones and stones, unaware of their scientific significance.
    <br><br>
    Mongolia in the early 20th century was largely unexplored by Western science, a vast territory of myth, legend, and mystery. Tales circulated about hidden treasures beneath the Gobi sands—stories that would soon inspire an adventurous scientist to embark on an epic expedition.
